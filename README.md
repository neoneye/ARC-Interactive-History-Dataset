# ARC-Interactive-History-Dataset

This is a project that records human interactions while solving tasks from ARC, [Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus](https://github.com/fchollet/ARC) and similar datasets. This repository is populated with data via the [BrainGridGame](https://braingridgame.com/) website, where enthusiasts like you can challenge themselves.

## About the Project

This project aims to build a comprehensive dataset of interaction histories to facilitate ARC research. Each time a user solves a task on BrainGridGame, their interaction is anonymously recorded and contributes to this growing dataset, providing valuable insights into human problem-solving processes.

## Contribute by solving tasks

To contribute to this dataset by solving tasks, you'll need to:

- Visit [BrainGridGame](https://braingridgame.com/)
- Sign in using your Google account (no password needed).
- Solve some of the harder tasks. There are already many solutions for the easiest tasks.

Every solved task helps enrich this dataset.
